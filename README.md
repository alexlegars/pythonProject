# Recipick

This website allows you to find a recipe according to the ingredients you already have. It also suggests you the ingredients you're missing for the recipe you want to cook.

You first have to download the dataset in csv at this address : https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd
Or, you can download the csv with this command if you have kaggle installed : kaggle datasets download -d START-UMD/gtd

Then, put the csv in the "data" folder.

To launch the converter from csv to json, just type this in your console :
python app.py
OR 
python3 app.py
